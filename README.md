# hello-world
Initiating my long and prosperous journey in the computer world.
To whoever it may concern,
I am 19 years old, a car salesman, unwantedly. I was told that if I "wanted to make money" that was the place to do so. However, this, this is what I love doing. This is what I can do for hours and hours and not have enough of it. Coding is something I have been wanting to learn for a long time now, but my circumstances never made it possible. Yet, I am now trying my hardest to make my dream come true. I know I am young, and a long path lies ahead of me, but it's never too early to begin. The key is starting, everything else is just learning. I know I can dedicate my life to this, and be happy. Knowledge is power, and I am ready to learn everything I can. I am prepared and I fear not of what is ahead, as I know I am never alone.

                                                                                                                -Angel Mena
